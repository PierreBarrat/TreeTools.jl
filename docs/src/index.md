# TreeTools.jl

TreeTools is a package to allow manipulation and simple operations on *rooted* phylogenetic or genealogic trees. 
It started off as a dependency of another package [TreeKnit](https://github.com/PierreBarrat/TreeKnit.jl), but can in principle be used for any problem involving trees. 

## Installation

You can simply install TreeTools using the julia package manager (if you don't have julia, you can get it from [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/)): 
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("TreeTools")
```
You should now be able to use `using TreeKnit` from inside julia and follow the rest of the documentation.
