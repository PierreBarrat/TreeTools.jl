# TreeTools

Simple tools for handling *rooted* phylogenetic or genealogic trees with Julia. 
I used this package for all of my work related to trees and found it useful. I hope you will to! 
A very brief list of what it can do: 
- read and write Newick files
- attach arbitrary data to tree nodes
- compute distance between nodes in a tree, their most recent common ancestor, etc...
- traverse the tree (post-order or arbitrary)
- prune nodes, insert nodes, remove singletons
- re-root the tree (docs not written yet)
- decompose the tree into [splits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_(phylogenetics)) and perform operations on them (docs not written yet) 

Please read the [documentation](https://pierrebarrat.github.io/TreeTools.jl) to discover what you can do with the package.
